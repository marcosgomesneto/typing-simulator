# Typing Simulator for VSCode

The **Typing Simulator** plugin is tailored for live presentations or video tutorials, offering a seamless way to simulate the typing of pre-written code. This feature proves invaluable by eliminating the risk of typos during presentations, allowing you to focus on your speech and presentation rather than worrying about the code input.

## Key Features

- **Code Source Flexibility:** Whether your code is in an open file in VSCode or copied to the clipboard, Typing Simulator has you covered.

- **Two Simulation Modes:**

  - _Automatic:_ Let the plugin simulate human-like typing automatically.
  - _Manual:_ Control the simulation by manually pressing keys, offering flexibility and a more interactive experience during presentations.

- **Customizable Simulation Behavior:**

  - Set line-specific behaviors, such as ignoring a line or defining breakpoints.
  - Adjust the typing speed for automatic mode, tailoring it to your presentation style.

- **Convenient Shortcuts (Tip):** To enhance your control over the simulation during live presentations or video recording, configure custom shortcuts in VSCode. Access VSCode's Keyboard Shortcuts settings (`File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts`), search for Typing Simulator commands, and assign your preferred shortcuts.

## Available Commands:

- **Typing Simulator: Start Typing From Current File**
- **Typing Simulator: Start Typing From Clipboard**
- **Typing Simulator: Pause Typing**
- **Typing Simulator: Continue Typing**
- **Typing Simulator: Stop Typing**
